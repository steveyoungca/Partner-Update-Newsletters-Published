# Solved: Microsoft OneNote Touch Not Working When Using Dual Screens
 I solved an issue I was having when using Microsoft OneNote on my Surface Laptop with a touch screen when using a secondary, non-touch monitor.  I discovered a solution, or is that workaround that solved the issue.  Microsoft OneNote is one of those productivity tools I  cannot live without in my study and work life. 

### Home Office Dual Monitor Setup

 When I work at home, my Setup is pictured below; I usually plug into a secondary monitor but have the monitor set up above the laptop instead of left or right.  I find it is less stressful to look up and down than to the left or right for an extended period.

### Touch and Pen Input => My Productive Workflow 
Having the touch screen and the Pen, I can highlight and annotate study notes or research.  I make extensive use of clipping web pages to OneNote and then use these as research notes.
My work machine is a Microsoft Surface Laptop Gen 1 and has a touch screen.  I also have a 2019 Macbook Pro 16" but find work-related activities, including Office, I am more productive on Windows.

### Problem: Pen worked, but Not Touch !!!!!

I noticed a bug when I was using my dual monitor setup.  I made notes, highlighted my research and selected menu options in OneNote with a pen, but touching the screen would not allow me to choose options or, more frustrating, scroll up and down the document.  

In my mind, this is a bug and was almost a show stopper.

In a side note, making a screen, the primary display gives you the following additional options, which I did not want on my primary monitor due to distractions.:

* Show the taskbar on one (the primary) or both monitors
* The primary, or default monitor is where Windows will display notifications and other messages.
* You can also change settings on either monitor such as resolution, brightness, resolution, text size and display orientation.
* Where your system icon tray and badges are displayed 

### Fell into the "solution"

When I made the change so that my Surface Laptop was my primary display, I fell into the solution that OneNote touch scrolling worked again.

There is an option in the **Display Settings** in Windows where you can select which monitor you would like to have as your primary monitor, also called the Default monitor, **Main screen**.   

Let's walk through this change.

1. Just **right click** on the desktop and see the following menu where you select **Display Settings**.

2. You will then see the **Display** menu.  As pictured below, select the Touch screen that you want to use.  In my case, my Surface Laptop was Screen 1 as Screen 2 was the external monitor.

3. Scroll down to the **Multiple Display** options.  Here you can select which monitor to only display on, duplicate or extend, in my case, to use both.

4. Since I selected Screen 1, my touch screen Surface Laptop with touch, the settings will change this monitor.  As pictured below, the **Make this my main display** had not been selected.

When I selected this option, I discovered a little while later that I could scroll using OneNote again.

SO, Now back to working and productivity !!  Not sure if my problem was a bug or a feature of not being on the primary screen.

I had worked around this issue by using my iPad, which has an excellent implementation of OneNote and synchronizes with my Windows OneNote like a charm.  Now only if I had a touch screen Mac to go along with it.  LOL.
