## SQL Database and Azure Synapse 

Update your network configuration to allow communication with new Azure SQL Database gateways by 1 September 2020

To improve performance and reduce login latency, we're adding new SQL Database gateways in these regions on 1 September 2020: 

	• South Central US 
	• West US 2 
	• North Europe 
	• West Europe 

As a result, the public IP addresses of your SQL databases may change. 
Recommended action.

The following link will take you to the documentation.  
[Gateway IP addresses](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/connectivity-architecture#gateway-ip-addresses) - The table below lists the IP Addresses of Gateways by region. To connect to SQL Database or Azure Synapse, you need to allow network traffic to and from all Gateways for the region.
